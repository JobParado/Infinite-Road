# 🚗 Infinite Road (Unity)

A simple 2D endless driving game built with **Unity**.  
The player controls a car on an infinite road and must avoid obstacles while trying to survive as long as possible.  
This project was created as part of my self-learning journey in Unity after completing their unity essential and programming course.
