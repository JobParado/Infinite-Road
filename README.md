# Infinite-Road
A simple 2D endless driving game built in Unity. The player controls a car and must navigate an infinite road while avoiding obstacles.

This was my first independent Unity project, created as a way to apply what I learned from Unityâ€™s beginner course of unity essentials and programming.
